DUCK HUNT - Nick Graves

This game was made for homework 10 for CS 2110, Fall 2014 at Georgia Tech.

Duck Hunt is a classic NES game where the player uses a light gun to shoot
ducks that fly around on screen.  In this GBA version, the player controls
the reticle instead of a light gun.  The game play is the same, though: you have 3 shots to hit a duck.  If you miss all 3 shots, you lose.  If you shoot 9 ducks
without losing, then you win!

Controls:

D-pad to move the reticle
A button to shoot
